# ðŸ“˜ Python Assignments  

Welcome to my Python Assignments repository!  
This is where I document my journey of learning Python step by step through weekly projects and practice tasks. Each week builds on the last; from writing my first calculator to handling files and functionsâ€”all in one place.

## ðŸš€ Whatâ€™s Inside  

### ðŸ§® Week 1 â€“ Basic Calculator  
I built a simple calculator that takes two numbers and an operator, then performs addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division.  
ðŸ‘‰ My first hands-on practice with input, variables, and operators.

### ðŸ“‹ Week 2 â€“ Working with Lists  
This week was all about Python lists. I learned how to:  
- Append and insert values  
- Extend a list with multiple elements  
- Remove items  
- Sort lists  
- Find indexes  

ðŸ‘‰ End result: a well-structured list after different operations.

### ðŸ’° Week 3 â€“ Functions & Discounts  
Here, I created a function that calculates the final price of an item after applying a discount.  
ðŸ‘‰ A practical way to learn functions, parameters, and return values, while making the code reusable.

### ðŸ“‚ Week 4 â€“ File Handling  
I explored reading and writing files in Python.  
I practiced with:  
- `open()` in read and write modes  
- `read()`, `readline()`, and `write()`  
- Handling errors like `FileNotFoundError` and `ValueError`  

ðŸ‘‰ Now I can create, read, and update text files smoothly.

## ðŸ”® Whatâ€™s Next  
This repository will keep growing as I take on new assignments. Some upcoming topics include:  
- Dictionaries & loops  
- Error handling  
- Object-Oriented Programming  
- Modules & packages  
- Mini projects

## âš¡ How to Run  
Clone this repo and navigate into the folder. Then run any assignment file with Python:  

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Mutindadev/python_assignment.git
cd python_assignment
python week1_assignment.py
```
Replace `week1_assignment.py` with the assignment file you want to run.

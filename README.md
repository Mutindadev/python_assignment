# 📘 Python Assignments  

Welcome to my Python Assignments repository!  
This is where I document my journey of learning Python step by step through weekly projects and practice tasks. Each week builds on the last; from writing my first calculator to handling files and functions—all in one place.

## 🚀 What’s Inside  

### 🧮 Week 1 – Basic Calculator  
I built a simple calculator that takes two numbers and an operator, then performs addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division.  
👉 My first hands-on practice with input, variables, and operators.  

---

### 📋 Week 2 – Working with Lists  
This week was all about Python lists. I learned how to:  
- Append and insert values  
- Extend a list with multiple elements  
- Remove items  
- Sort lists  
- Find indexes  

👉 End result: a well-structured list after different operations.  

---

### 💰 Week 3 – Functions & Discounts  
Here, I created a function that calculates the final price of an item after applying a discount.  
👉 A practical way to learn functions, parameters, and return values, while making the code reusable.  

---

### 📂 Week 4 – File Handling  
I explored reading and writing files in Python.  
I practiced with:  
- `open()` in read and write modes  
- `read()`, `readline()`, and `write()`  
- Handling errors like `FileNotFoundError` and `ValueError`  

👉 Now I can create, read, and update text files smoothly.

## 📘 Week 5: Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

### 🏗 Assignment 1: Design Your Own Class
- Created a *Smartphone class* with attributes and methods.  
- Used *constructors* to initialize each object.  
- Demonstrated *encapsulation* by making price private with getters and setters.  
- Added an *inheritance layer* through a GamingSmartphone class.  
- Showcased *polymorphism* by overriding methods.

---
---

### 🎭 Activity 2: Polymorphism Challenge
- Built a *Vehicle base class* with subclasses (Car, Plane, Boat).  
- Each subclass defined its own move() method.
